  Rules:
  - Name: Power Matrix
    Rule: 'Certain areas of the battlefield are considered to be within your army''s
      Power Matrix, as follows:

      - Your deployment zone is always within your
      army''s Power Matrix.

      - At the start of any phase, if you control at
      least half of the objective markers within No Man''s Land, until the end of
      that phase, No Man''s Land is within your army''s Power Matrix.

      - At
      the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers
      within your opponent''s deployment zone, until the end of that phase, your
      opponent''s deployment zone is within your army''s Power Matrix.

      Each
      time a model in a CRYPTEK or CANOPTEK unit from your army makes an attack,
      re-roll a Hit roll of 1. If such a unit is wholly within your Power Matrix,
      you can re-roll the Hit roll instead.'
  - Name: Reanimation Protocols
    Rule: "If your Army Faction is NECRONS, at the end of your\_Command phase, each
      unit from your army with this\_ability that is on the battlefield activates
      its Reanimation Protocols and reanimates\_D3 wounds. Each time such a unit
      reanimates a wound:\n\u25A0 If that unit contains one or more models with fewer\_than
      their starting number of wounds remaining,\_select one of those models; that
      model regains one\_lost wound.\n\u25A0 If all models in that unit have their
      starting number of\_wounds, but that unit is not at its Starting Strength,\_one
      destroyed model is returned to that unit with one\_wound remaining.\nOnce such
      a unit is at its Starting Strength and all of its\_models have their starting
      number of wounds, nothing\_further happens."
  - Name: Feel No Pain 4+
    Rule: 'Some models have ''Feel No Pain x+'' listed in their abilities. Each time
      a model with this ability suffers damage and so would lose a wound (including
      wounds lost due to mortal wounds), roll one D6: if the result is greater than
      or equal to the number denoted by ''x: that wound is ignored and is not lost.
      If a model has more than one Feel No Pain ability, you can only use one of
      those abilities each time that model suffers damage and so would lose a wound.'
  - Name: Extra Attacks
    Rule: Weapons with [EXTRA ATTACKS] in their profile are known as Extra Attacks
      weapons. Each time the bearer of such a weapon fights, it can make attacks
      with that weapon in addition to the one it chooses to fight with. The number
      of attacks made with an Extra Attacks weapon cannot be modified by other rules.
  - Name: Leader
    Rule: While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit
      and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed
      (pg 12), it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an
      attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all
      of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard
      models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness
      characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that
      attack cannot be allocated to a Character model in that unit, even if that
      Character model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated
      to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has
      been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated
      can then be allocated to Character models in that unit.
  - Name: Ignores Cover
    Rule: Weapons with [IGNORES COVER] in their profile are known as Ignores Cover
      weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, the target cannot
      have the Benefit of Cover against that attack.
  - Name: Torrent
    Rule: Weapons with [TORRENT] in their profile are known as Torrent weapons. Each
      time an attack is made with such a weapon, that attack automatically hits the
      target.
  - Name: Devastating Wounds
    Rule: "Weapons with [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] in their profile\_are known as Devastating
      Wounds weapons. Each\_time an attack is made with such a weapon, if that\_attack
      scores a Critical Wound, no saving throw of\_any kind can be made against that
      attack (including\_invulnerable saving throws). Such attacks are only\_allocated
      to models after all other attacks made by\_the attacking unit have been allocated
      and resolved"
  - Name: Blast
    Rule: "Weapons with [BLAST] in their profile are known as Blast weapons, and
      they make a random number of attacks. Each time you determine how many attacks
      are made with a Blast weapon, add 1 to the result for every five models that
      were in the target unit when you selected it as the target (rounding down).
      Blast weapons can never be used to make attacks against a unit that is within
      Engagement Range of one or more units from the attacking model\u2019s army
      (including its own unit)."
  - Name: Lethal Hits
    Rule: Weapons with [LETHAL HITS] in their profile are known as Lethal Hits weapons.
      Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, a Critical Hit automatically
      wounds the target.
  - Name: Rapid Fire
    Rule: "Weapons with [RAPID FIRE X] in their profile are known as Rapid Fire weapons.
      Each time such a weapon targets a unit within half that weapon\u2019s range,
      the Attacks characteristic of that weapon is increased by the amount denoted
      by \u2018x\u2019."
  - Name: Assault
    Rule: "Weapons with [ASSAULT] in their profile are known as Assault weapons.
      If a unit that Advanced this turn contains any models equipped with Assault
      weapons, it is still eligible to shoot in this turn\u2019s Shooting phase.
      When such a unit is selected to shoot, you can only resolve attacks using Assault
      weapons its models are equipped with."
  - Name: Sustained Hits
    Rule: "Weapons with [SUSTAINED HITS X] in their profile are known as Sustained
      Hits weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if a Critical
      Hit is rolled, that attack scores a number of additional hits on the target
      as denoted by \u2018x\u2019"
  - Name: Pistol
    Rule: "Weapons with [PISTOL] in their profile are known as Pistols. If a unit
      contains any models equipped with Pistols, that unit is eligible to shoot in
      its controlling player\u2019s Shooting phase even while it is within Engagement
      Range of one or more enemy units. When such a unit is selected to shoot, it
      can only resolve attacks using its Pistols and can only target one of the enemy
      units it is within Engagement Range of. In such circumstances, a Pistol can
      target an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within Engagement Range
      of the same enemy unit.\_\n\nIf a model is equipped with one or more Pistols,
      unless it is a MONSTER or VEHICLE model, it can either shoot with its Pistols
      or with all of its other ranged weapons. Declare whether such a model will
      shoot with its Pistols or its other ranged weapons before selecting targets."
  - Name: Deadly Demise D3
    Rule: Some models have 'Deadly Demise x' listed in their abilities. When such
      a model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play (if such a model
      is a TRANSPORT, roll before any embarked models disembark). On a 6, each unit
      within 6" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by 'x' (if
      this is a random number, roll separately for each unit within 6").
  - Name: Heavy
    Rule: "Weapons with [HEAVY] in their profile are known as Heavy weapons. Each
      time an attack is made with such a weapon, if the attacking model\u2019s unit
      Remained Stationary this turn, add 1 to that attack\u2019s Hit roll."
  - Name: Twin-linked
    Rule: "Weapons with [TWIN-LINKED] in their profile are known as Twin-linked weapons.
      Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, you can re-roll that attack\u2019s
      Wound roll."
  - Name: Unparalleled Foresight
    Rule: "Each time an Aeldari unit from your army is\_selected to shoot or fight,
      you can re-roll one Hit roll\_and you can re-roll one Wound roll when resolving\_those
      attacks"
  - Name: Strands of Fate
    Rule: "If your Army Faction is AELDARI, at the start of the\_battle, make a Strands
      of Fate roll by rolling six D6.\_\n\n\nIf you wish, you can then re-roll all
      of these dice, but\_if you do, roll one less D6. You can continue re-rolling\_all
      of the dice in this manner, rolling one less D6 each\_time you do, until you
      are satisfied with the results\_rolled (or until you only have a single D6
      remaining).\n\n\nWhen you are satisfied with the results rolled, those\_remaining
      dice become your Fate dice for the battle.\_These results cannot be changed
      or re-rolled further,\_unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your\_Fate
      dice to one side \u2013 this is your Fate dice pool.\n\n\nOnce per phase, before
      making a dice roll for a model\_or unit from your army with the Strands of
      Fate ability,\_if you have one or more dice in your Fate dice pool,\_you can
      use one of those Fate dice. To do so, select\_one of those Fate dice to substitute
      that dice roll. The\_dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead,\_the
      value of the selected Fate dice is used as if it had\_been rolled (this counts
      as an unmodified dice roll\_of that value for all rules purposes). Each Fate
      dice\_can only be used in this way once. After using a Fate\_dice, remove it
      from your Fate dice pool and roll all\_remaining dice that are part of that
      dice roll (if any).\_You can use Fate dice for any of the following types\_of
      dice roll:\n\u25A0 Advance roll\n\u25A0 Battle-shock test\n\u25A0 Charge roll\n\u25A0
      Damage roll\n\u25A0 Hit roll\n\u25A0 Saving throw\n\u25A0 Wound roll"
  - Name: Lone Operative
    Rule: Unless part of an Attached unit, this unit can only be selected as the
      target of a ranged attack if the attacking model is within 12".
  - Name: Deep Strike
    Rule: During the Declare Battle Formations step, if every model in a unit has
      this ability, you can set it up in Reserves instead of setting it up on the
      battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement
      phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than
      9" horizontally away from all enemy models.
  - Name: Melta
    Rule: "Weapons with [MELTA X] in their profile are known as Melta weapons. Each
      time an attack made with such a weapon targets a unit within half that weapon\u2019s
      range, that attack\u2019s Damage characteristic is increased by the amount
      denoted by \u2018x\u2019."
  - Name: Psychic
    Rule: Some weapons and abilities can only be used by PSYKERS. Such weapons and
      abilities are tagged with the word 'Psychic'. If a Psychic weapon or ability
      causes any unit to suffer one or more wounds, each of those wounds is considered
      to have been inflicted by a Psychic Attack.
  - Name: Infiltrators
    Rule: During deployment, if every model in a unit has this ability, then when
      you set it up, it can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than
      9" horizontally away from the enemy deployment zone and all enemy models.
  - Name: Stealth
    Rule: "If every model in a unit has this ability, then each time a ranged attack
      is made against it, subtract 1 from that attack\u2019s Hit roll."
  - Name: Precision
    Rule: "Weapons with [PRECISION] in their profile are known as Precision weapons.
      Each time an attack made with such a weapon successfully wounds an Attached
      unit, if a Character model in that unit is visible to the attacking model,
      the attacking model\u2019s player can choose to have that attack allocated
      to that Character model instead of following the normal attack sequence."
  - Name: Scouts 9"
    Rule: "Some units have \u2018Scouts x\u2019 listed in their abilities. If every
      model in a unit has this ability, then at the start of the first battle round,
      before the first turn begins, it can make a Normal move of up to x\" as if
      it were your Movement phase \u2013 as can any DEDICATED TRANSPORT model such
      a unit starts the battle embarked within (provided only models with this ability
      are embarked within that DEDICATED TRANSPORT model). A unit that moves using
      this ability must end that move more than 9\\\" horizontally away from all
      enemy models. If both players have units that can do this, the player who is
      taking the first turn moves their units first."
  - Name: Deadly Demise 1
    Rule: Some models have 'Deadly Demise x' listed in their abilities. When such
      a model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play (if such a model
      is a TRANSPORT, roll before any embarked models disembark). On a 6, each unit
      within 6" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by 'x' (if
      this is a random number, roll separately for each unit within 6").
